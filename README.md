##  Project Overview

This project explores student feedback from Drexel Universityâ€™s Cooperative Education (Co-op) program between 2017 and 2020. By analyzing open-ended survey responses and structured data, the goal was to uncover meaningful insights about student experiences, skill development, and emotional sentiment across multiple dimensions such as major, co-op cycle, and citizenship status.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) was used to analyze qualitative responses, and interactive dashboards were built in Tableau to make trends and patterns easy to visualize.

## Key Objectives

- Identify the most frequently mentioned skills students developed or wanted to improve.
- Understand how co-op experiences varied by academic major, year, and number of completed co-op cycles.
- Analyze student sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) using NLP tools.
- Visualize participation trends and feedback patterns across different student demographics.

## Insights & Findings

### ðŸ’¡ Top Skills Cited by Students:
- **Time Management** was the most frequently mentioned skill (**24.79%** of responses).
- Other common skills included **networking**, **problem-solving**, **statistics**, and **economics**.

### Participation Trends:
- **2018** had the highest number of co-op experiences recorded.
- Participation levels remained fairly consistent across all four years (2017â€“2020).

### Academic Program Highlights:
- Students from **Economics (ECON)**, **Marketing (MKTG)**, **Accounting (ACCT)**, **Finance (FIN)**, and **Management Information Systems (MIS)** contributed the most feedback.

### ðŸ’¬ Sentiment Analysis Results:
Using **VADER Sentiment Analysis** from Python's **NLTK** library:
- **37.5%** of student responses were positive.
- **60.7%** were neutral.
- Only **1.7%** expressed negative sentiment.

## Interactive Dashboards

Two Tableau dashboards were created to visualize:
- Skill frequency across programs and years  
- Sentiment and participation trends segmented by major, co-op cycle, and citizenship status

## âœ… Outcomes

This project demonstrated the power of combining structured data analysis with NLP to uncover both qualitative and quantitative insights. It provided a clearer understanding of how Drexel students perceive and grow from their co-op experiencesâ€”insights that can be used to improve future program planning, support services, and engagement strategies.
